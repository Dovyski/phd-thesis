%% Tabular

% Nice tabular rules
\RequirePackage{booktabs}

% The pack­age de­fines new com­mands \Cen­ter­ing, \RaggedLeft,
% and \RaggedRight and new en­vi­ron­ments Cen­ter, FlushLeft,
% and FlushRight, which set ragged text and are eas­ily
% con­fig­urable to al­low hy­phen­ation (the cor­re­spond­ing
% com­mands in LATEX, all of whose names are lower-case,
% pre­vent hy­phen­ation al­to­gether).
\RequirePackage{ragged2e}

% To be able to define new tabular column types
\RequirePackage{array}
% Left-aligned, fixed width column
\newcolumntype{L}[1]{>{\RaggedRight\arraybackslash}p{#1}}
% Right-aligned, fixed width column
\newcolumntype{R}[1]{>{\RaggedLeft\arraybackslash}p{#1}}
% Centered, fixed width column
