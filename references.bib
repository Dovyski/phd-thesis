  abstract  = {In  order to improve intelligent Human-Computer Interaction it  is  important to create a  
personalized
adaptive emotion estimator that  is  able  to  learn  over  time  emotional  response  
idiosyncrasies of individual person and thus  enhance estimation accuracy.  This   paper,  with the 
 aim of  identifying preferable methods  for  such a  concept, presents  an   experiment-based  
comparative study of  seven feature reduction and seven machine learning methods commonly used for  
emotion estimation based on   physiological  signals.  The   analysis was  performed  on   data  
obtained in   an   emotion  elicitation experiment  involving 14  participants. Speciﬁc discrete 
emotions were targeted with stimuli from the International Affective Picture System database. The 
experiment was necessary to achieve the uniformity in   the  various aspects  of   emotion  
elicitation, data  processing, feature  calculation, self-reporting procedures and estimation 
evaluation, in order to avoid inconsistency problems that arise when results from studies that use 
different emotion-related databases are mutually compared. The  results of  the performed 
experiment indicate that the combination of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sequential ﬂoating 
forward selection (SFFS) exhibited the highest accuracy in discrete emotion classiﬁcation based on 
physiological features calculated from ECG, respiration, skin conductance and skin temperature. 
Using leave-one-session-out crossvalidation method, 60.3%  accuracy in  classiﬁcation of  5  
discrete emotions (sadness, disgust, fear, happiness and neutral) was obtained. In order to 
identify which methods may be the most suitable for real-time estimator adaptation, execution and 
learning times of emotion estimators were also comparatively analyzed. Based on  this analysis, 
preferred feature reduction method for  real- time estimator adaptation was minimum redundancy – 
maximum relevance (mRMR), which was the fastest approach in  terms of  combined execution and 
learning time, as  well as  the second best in accuracy,  after  SFFS.  In   combination with  
mRMR,   highest  accuracies were  achieved by   k-nearest neighbor (kNN)  and MLP with  negligible 
difference (50.33% versus 50.54%); however,  mRMR þ kNN  is preferable option for real-time 
estimator adaptation due to considerably lower combined execution and
learning time of kNN  versus MLP.},

with physiological measurements to predict rated emotion (trained coders’ second-by-second assessments of sadness or amusement).
Input consisted of videotapes of 41 subjects watching emotionally evocative films along with measures of their cardiovascular activity,
somatic activity, and electrodermal responding. We built algorithms based on extracted points from the subjects’ faces as well as their
physiological responses. Strengths of the current approach are (1) we are assessing real behavior of subjects watching emotional videos
instead of actors making facial poses, (2) the training data allow us to predict both emotion type (amusement versus sadness) as well as
the intensity level of each emotion, (3) we provide a direct comparison between person-specific, gender-specific, and general models.
Results demonstrated good fits for the models overall, with better performance for emotion categories than for emotion intensity, for
amusement ratings than sadness ratings, for a full model using both physiological measures and facial tracking than for either cue alone,
and for person-specific models than for gender-specific or general models.

  abstract  = {Contact-free camera-based measurement of cognitive stress opens up new possibilities for human-computer interaction with applications in remote learning, stress monitoring, and optimization of workload for user experience. The autonomic nervous system controls the inter-beat intervals of the heart and breathing patterns, and these signals change under cognitive stress. We built a participant-independent cognitive stress recognition model based on photoplethysmographic signals measured remotely at a distance of 3 meters. We tested the model on naturalistic responses from 10 individuals completing randomized-order computer-based tasks (ball control and card sorting). The system successfully detected increased stress during the tasks, which were consistent with self-report measures. Changes in heart rate variability were more discriminative indicators of cognitive stress than were heart rate and breathing rate.},

by adapting game difficulty according to player’s emotions
assessed from physiological signals. The validity of this approach
was first tested by analyzing the questionnaire responses, electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals, and peripheral signals of the
players playing a Tetris game at three difficulty levels. This analysis
confirms that the different difficulty levels correspond to
distinguishable emotions, and that, playing several times at the
same difficulty level gives rise to boredom. The next step was to
train several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional
classes from EEG and peripheral signals in a player-independent
framework. By using either type of signals, the emotional classes
were successfully recovered, with EEG having a better accuracy
than peripheral signals on short periods of time. After the fusion
of the two signal categories, the accuracy raised up to 63%.},

  abstract  = {The aim was to evaluate the cardiovascular and subjective stress response to a combined physical and mental workload, and the effect of rest. Twelve females who had no prior experience of laboratory experiments participated in the study. Computer-work-related mental stressors were either added to or removed from a standardized computer work session in the laboratory. Beat-to-beat blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded continuously during the experiment. The participants reported subjective experiences of stress in six categories using an 11-point scale before and at the end of the work. Heart rate variability (HRV) variables were calculated from the ECG recordings, and a reduction in the high-frequency component of HRV and an increase in the low- to high-frequency ratio were observed in the stress situation compared to the control session. No changes were seen in the low-frequency component of HRV. The stressors induced an increase in blood pressure compared to baseline that persisted, and for the diastolic pressure it even increased in the subsequent control session. No differences were observed for subjective experience of stress with the exception of a time trend in the exhaustion scale, i.e. a progression in reported exhaustion with time. The results and the dissociation between HRV and blood pressure variables—indicate that HRV is a more sensitive and selective measure of mental stress. It could be speculated that heart rate-derived variables reflect a central pathway in cardiovascular control mechanisms (‘‘central command’’), while the blood pressure response is more influenced by local conditions in the working muscles that partly mask the effect of changes in mental workloads. In the rest period after each work session, HRV and blood pressure variables were partly normalized as expected. However, an 8-min period of rest was insufficient to restore blood pressure to resting values.},

  abstract  = {Small beat-to-beat differences in heart rate are the
result of dynamic control of the cardiovascular system by the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Heart
rate variability (HRV) has been positively correlated with
both mental and physical health. While many studies measure
HRV under rest conditions, few have measured HRV during
stressful situations. We describe an experimental protocol
designed to measure baseline, task, and recovery values of
HRV as a function of three different types of stressors. These
stressors involve an attention task, a cold pressor test, and a
videotaped speech presentation. We found a measurable
change in heart rate in participants (n=10) during each task
(all p’s < 0.05). The relative increase or decrease from pretask
heart rate was predicted by task (one-way ANOVA,
p=0.0001). Spectral analysis of HRV during the attention task
revealed consistently decreased measures of both high
(68±7%, mean±S.E.) and low (62±13%) frequency HRV
components as compared to baseline. HRV spectra for the
cold pressor and speech tasks revealed no consistent patterns
of increase or decrease from baseline measurements. We also
found no correlation in reactivity measures between any of
our tasks. These findings suggest that each of the tasks in our
experimental design elicits a different type of stress response
in an individual. Our experimental approach may prove
useful to biobehavioral researchers searching for factors that
determine individual differences in responses to stress in
daily life.},

  abstract  = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that
can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue.
It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The
PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile (‘AC’) physiological waveform attributed
to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat,
and is superimposed on a slowly varying (‘DC’) baseline with various lower
frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system
activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of
the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they
can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has
been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the
demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care
and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and
small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based
pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a
wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen
saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function
and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the
topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light
with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement
protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications
of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological
monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function.},

work well on stationary subjects under well controlled

the videos are recorded under more challenging conditions,

our framework on a large difficult and public database

  abstract  = {Photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI) and infrared thermography imaging (IRTI) are contactless camera-based measurement methods for monitoring a wide range of basic vital parameters. In particular, PPGI enhances the classical contact-based photoplethysmography. Approved evaluation algorithms of the well-established PPG method can easily be adapted for detection of heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate (RR), respiratory variability (RV), and vasomotional activity with PPGI. The IRTI method primarily records temperature distribution of the observed object, but information on RR and RV can also be derived from IRTI by analyzing the development of temperature distribution in the nasal region. The main advantages of both monitoring methods are unobtrusive data acquisition and the possibility of assessing spatial assignment between vital parameters and body region. Hence, these methods enable long-term monitoring or the monitoring of effects with special local characteristics. Because the two systems supplement each, a combined hybrid application is proposed and its feasibility discussed.},

  abstract  = {We present a new method for measuring photoplethysmogram
(PPG) signals remotely using ambient light
and a digital camera that allows for accurate recovery of the
waveform morphology (from a distance of 3m). In particular,
we show that the peak-to-peak time between the systolic peak
and diastolic peak/inflection can be automatically recovered using
the second order derivative of the remotely measured waveform.
We compare measurements from the face with those captured
using a contact finger-tip sensor and show high agreement in
peak and interval timings. Furthermore, we show that results
can be significantly improved using orange, green and cyan color
channels compared to the tradition red, green and blue channel
combination. The absolute error in inter-beat-intervals was 26ms
and the absolute error in mean systolic-diastolic peak-to-peak
times was 12ms. The mean systolic-diastolic peak-to-peak times
measured using the contact sensor and the camera were highly
correlated, ρ = 0.94 (p<0.001). The results were obtained with a
camera frame-rate of only 30Hz. This technology has significant
potential for advancing healthcare.},

(rPPG) enables low-cost, non-contact cardiovascular activity
monitoring. However, applying rPPG to practical use has some
limitations caused from the artifacts by illuminance changes.
During watching a video in a dark room, for example, watching
a TV at night without illuminance, there is a high correlation
between the brightness changes of a video and the illuminance
variation on the skin of the viewer’s face. In this study, we
propose an artifact reduction method in rPPG, which is caused
by the variation of the illuminance. The method subtracts the
artifacts from the raw facial rPPG signal by applying
multi-order curve fitting between the illuminance information
from the facial rPPG signal and the brightness information
from a video. On average, the results showed that signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) increased from -11.74 to -4.19 dB and from -15.27 to
7.99 dB for low-dynamic-brightness and
high-dynamic-brightness video, respectively. In addition, the
root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of estimated heart rate
decreased from 11.00 to 1.82 bpm and from 9.88 to 4.65 bpm for
the videos, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies in computer vision have shown that, while practically invisible to a human observer, skin color changes due to blood flow can be captured on face videos and, surprisingly, be used to estimate the heart rate (HR). While considerable progress has been made in the last few years, still many issues remain open. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches are not robust enough to operate in natural conditions (e.g. in case of spontaneous movements, facial expressions, or illumination changes). Opposite to previous approaches that estimate the HR by processing all the skin pixels inside a fixed region of interest, we introduce a strategy to dynamically select face regions useful for robust HR estimation. Our approach, inspired by recent advances on matrix completion theory, allows us to predict the HR while simultaneously discover the best regions of the face to be used for estimation. Thorough experimental evaluation conducted on public benchmarks suggests that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art HR estimation methods in naturalistic conditions.},

3D dynamic imaging, high-resolution 2D video, and thermal

blood pressure, and heart rate. Facial expression was annotated

minimization, with the required posterior probability inferred

noise, the contribution of each observation is weighted based
on the observation’s likelihood to contain relevant data. A
bandpass filter is applied to the estimated PPG waveform to
omit implausible heart rate frequencies, and the heart rate
is estimated through frequency domain analysis. Experimental
results acquired from a set of thirty videos indicate
significantly improved performance in comparison to stateof-the-art
