\chapter{Ethics and privacy}
\label{ch:ethics}

This chapter will comment about the ethical and privacy implications of my approach. I will not focus on how ethically I conducted my work, but how the final result could have ethical/pricavy implicaitons. One big example is that questionnaires allow users to lie about or refuse to answer something, while my approach will collect several information from the user without decisions (assuming users allowed the use of the software on them).

I have several references regarding ethics and privacy in HCI and IT that will ground this chapter.
