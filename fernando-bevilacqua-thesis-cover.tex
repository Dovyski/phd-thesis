Fernando Bevilacqua has a background in Computer Science (BSc), and Computation
focused on Computer Graphics (MSc) from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM),
Brazil. In 2003 he co-founded Decadium Studios, a video game
development company, where he worked for years in variety of applications and
games. In 2010 he joined academia by becoming a lecturer of Computer Science at
Federal University of Fronteira Sul (UFFS), in Chapec{\'o}, Brazil. Fernando is
an open-source evangelist whose academic interests include Games Research,
Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Vision.

In this thesis, Fernando presents a method for remote detection of emotional
states (boredom and stress) of a person during the interaction with
games. Player's heart rate and facial actions are used in the process, which are
automatically and remotely calculated from a video feed using Computer Vision.
Since the information is acquired remotely, no specialized equipment like physical
sensors is needed, only an ordinary camera and a computer are required.
Fernando supports the creation and testing of the proposed method with a
series of systematic evaluations conducted to better understand the relation
between psychophysiological signals and emotions of players. This thesis is an
initiative to move away from questionnaires and physical sensors into a
non-obtrusive, user-tailored, and remote-based approach for detecting user
emotions.
